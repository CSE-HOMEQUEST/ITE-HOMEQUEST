## I. Introduction
### Motivation: Why are you doing this?

  It is not easy to maintain healthy habits, household routines, and energy-saving behaviors consistently. Most existing apps treat all users the same and fail to reflect each family’s unique lifestyle patterns or smart-home usage behaviors. As a result, routines easily break down, and family engagement drops quickly.

  People also do not want to manually decide what tasks to do each day, coordinate household schedules, or constantly adjust smart-home devices. These repetitive micro-decisions create fatigue and inefficiency. To address these issues, we aim to develop an AI-based routine and challenge recommendation system that automatically suggests personalized activities using real behavior data, device usage logs, and past success or failure records.

  HomeQuest is not just a gamified household app; it is an intelligent system that recommends the right challenge at the right moment for each family. By combining smart-home data with personalized behavioral modeling, HomeQuest aims to increase family engagement, support healthier habits, and naturally optimize daily routines with minimal manual effort.

### what do you want to see at the end?
  We envision a smart home that goes beyond simply delivering information—a platform that seamlessly connects family members’ behaviors, habits, and meaningful changes.

  The ultimate goal of this project is to build an interactive challenge and feedback environment where AI analyzes IoT and wearable data to support shared participation and communication within the family.

  Through this system, we aim to create a smart-home experience in which small daily actions become meaningful motivation and enjoyable moments for every family member, ultimately transforming the home into a space that encourages collaboration, engagement, and positive routines.
