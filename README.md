## I. Introduction
### Motivation: Why are you doing this?

  We believe that smart homes should evolve beyond simply displaying appliance information and become an *experience platform* that naturally connects family members’ daily behaviors. However, current smart home services still follow a one-way structure—**providing data and expecting users to act on their own**—which makes it difficult to sustain real behavior change or meaningful family interaction.

  AI becomes essential in this project because it is the only technology capable of transforming the vast IoT and wearable data collected from everyday life into **personalized challenge experiences**. By learning each family’s life patterns, device-usage patterns, time preferences, and behavioral changes, AI can offer **sustainable and customized challenges**, **naturally facilitate interactions among family members**, and **generate motivating feedback based on their progress** in real time.

  With this approach, the smart home can move beyond a passive information system and become an **interactive space where families naturally participate and engage with one another**. In this environment, AI helps transform small everyday behaviors into shared moments of motivation, fun, and challenge—making the overall experience more meaningful and easier to sustain. This provides the foundation for what we aim to achieve with the HomeQuest project.

### what do you want to see at the end?
  We envision a smart home that goes beyond simply delivering information—a platform that seamlessly connects family members’ behaviors, habits, and meaningful changes.

  The ultimate goal of this project is to build an interactive challenge and feedback environment where AI analyzes IoT and wearable data to support shared participation and communication within the family.

  Through this system, we aim to create a smart-home experience in which small daily actions become meaningful motivation and enjoyable moments for every family member, ultimately transforming the home into a space that encourages collaboration, engagement, and positive routines.
